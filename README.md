## 📖 About The Project

This isn't just a showcase of my work; the website itself is a demonstration of my technical skills. I built this application from scratch to ensure maximum performance, type safety, and scalability.

It leverages **React 19** features and the lightning-fast **Vite 7** bundler to deliver a seamless user experience.

### 🌟 Key Features

- **Modern Architecture:** Built with React 19 & TypeScript for robust code.
- **Performance First:** Optimized assets, lazy loading, and extremely fast HMR.
- **Type Safety:** Strict TypeScript configuration.
